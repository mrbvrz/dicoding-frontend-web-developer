<p class="flow-text justify">Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble
    cast and follows several story arcs. One arc is about the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and follows
    a web of alliances and conflicts among the noble dynasties either vying to claim the throne or fighting for
    independence from it. Another focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been
    exiled to Essos and is plotting a return to the throne, while another story arc follows the Night's Watch, a
    brotherhood defending the realm against the fierce peoples and legendary creatures of the North.</p>

<p class="flow-text justify">Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and
    international fan base. The series was acclaimed by critics for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and
    production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) was criticized; the
    final season received further criticism for its condensed story and creative decisions, with many considering it a
    disappointing conclusion. The series received 58 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series, including
    Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards
    for Best Dramatic Presentation (2012–2014), a 2011 Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden Globe Award
    for Best Television Series – Drama (2012 and 2015–2018). Many critics and publications have named the show as one of
    the best television series of all time. <i><a target="_blank"
