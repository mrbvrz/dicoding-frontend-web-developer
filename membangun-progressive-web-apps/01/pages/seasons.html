                    <p>The story takes place in a fantasy world, primarily upon the continent Westeros, with one
                        storyline occurring on another
                        continent to the east, Essos. Like the novel, the season initially focuses on the family of
                        nobleman Eddard "Ned" Stark,
                        the Warden of the North, who is asked to become the King's Hand (chief advisor) to his longtime
                        friend, King Robert
                        Baratheon. Ned seeks to find out who murdered his predecessor, Jon Arryn.</p>

                    <p>The second season of the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones premiered in the United
                        States on HBO on April
                        1, 2012, and concluded on June 3, 2012. It was broadcast on Sunday at 9:00 pm in the United
                        States, consisting of 10
                        episodes, each running approximately 50–60 minutes. The season mostly covers the events of A
                        Clash of Kings, the second
                        novel of the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, adapted for television by
                        David Benioff and D. B.
                        Weiss. HBO ordered the second season on April 19, 2011, which began filming in July 2011,
                        primarily in Ireland, Northern
                        Ireland, Croatia and Iceland.</p>

                    <p>The story takes place in a fictional world, primarily upon a continent called Westeros, with one
                        storyline occurring on
                        another continent to the east, Essos. Like the novel, the season continues the storyline of The
                        War of the Five Kings:
                        after the death of Renly Baratheon, all four kings in Westeros believe they have a claim to the
                        Iron Throne, besides
                        Robb Stark, who seeks vengeance for the death of his father, Ned Stark, and independence for the
                        North. The season also
                        features other storylines: Daenerys Targaryen begins her rise in power in Essos; Ned's
                        illegitimate son, Jon Snow, goes
                        undercover beyond the Wall; the other Stark children struggle to survive up and down Westeros,
                        but Robb is killed; Jaime
                        Lannister returns to the capital; and all of Westeros is informed of the reawakened threat of
                        the Army of the Dead.</p>

                        storyline occurring on

                        three remaining kings in
                        Westeros believe they have a claim to the Iron Throne. King Joffrey is killed by poison at his
                        wedding, and his uncle
                        Tyrion is blamed; young Tommen Baratheon is crowned king. Meanwhile, Sansa Stark escapes King's
                        Landing. At the Wall,
                        Jon Snow and the Night's Watch, badly outnumbered, begin a grim battle against 100,000
                        Wildlings, but Stannis's army
                        sweeps in to demand the Wildlings' surrender. Bran Stark's visions lead him far beyond the Wall
                        to the north, where he
                        meets the Three-Eyed Raven. Daenerys Targaryen captures Meereen and decides to rule as queen of
                        Slaver's Bay until she
                        can permanently defeat the slavers; she finds ruling more difficult than conquering.</p>

                    <p>Like previous seasons in Game of Thrones, the fifth season continues storylines primarily set within the fictional land
                    of Westeros, while a few storylines are set in another continent, Essos. After the murders of King Joffrey and his
                    grandfather Tywin Lannister, Tywin's young, indecisive grandson, Tommen, rules Westeros as king. Tyrion flees to Essos,
                    where he meets Daenerys Targaryen, who struggles to rule Slavers' Bay and regain control over her growing dragons. The
                    Lannister family encounters new enemies, including a religious cult that Cersei foolishly empowers; they arrest her and
                    Queen Margaery; Cersei confesses some sins and is released after a walk of atonement. Jon Snow becomes Lord Commander of
                    the Night's Watch and serves under Stannis Baratheon, who pursues his claim to the Iron Throne by marching on the
                    rebuilt Winterfell. Littlefinger has left Sansa Stark at Winterfell; she marries Ramsay Bolton, who rapes and imprisons
                    her.

                    <p>The season follows the continuing struggle among the noble families of Westeros for the Iron Throne. The Starks and
                    allies defeat the Bolton forces in the "Battle of the Bastards", culminating with Sansa Stark feeding her tormenting
                    husband, Ramsay Bolton, — who had murdered his father, Roose; his stepfamily; and Rickon Stark — to his starving hounds,
                    and Jon Snow is proclaimed the King in the North. Tyrion rules Meereen while Daenerys is held captive by the Dothraki.
                    At King's Landing, Margaery capitulates to the High Sparrow, who becomes more powerful by influencing King Tommen. But
                    on the day of Cersei's trial, Cersei destroys the Great Sept with wildfire, killing the Sparrows, her uncle, and the
                    Tyrells. Tommen commits suicide, and Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Ellaria Sand and Oberyn Martell's
                    daughters kill Doran and Trystane Martell and seize control of Dorne. Arya Stark finishes her assassin training, escapes
                    Essos, and returns to Westeros to resume her revenge list. Bran Stark becomes the Three-Eyed Raven, escapes the White
                    Walkers, and returns to the Wall. Daenerys Targaryen burns the Khals, emerges from the flames of their temple alive, and
                    the Dothraki pledge her their loyalty.

                    <p>The penultimate season focuses on the convergence of the show's main plotlines in preparation for the final season.
                    Daenerys Targaryen arrives in Westeros with her army and three large dragons and begins to wage war against the
                    Lannisters, who have defeated her allies in the south and west of Westeros. Jon Snow leaves Sansa in charge of
                    Winterfell and visits Daenerys to secure her help to defeat the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead. He mines the
                    dragonglass at Dragonstone and begins a romance with Daenerys. Meanwhile Arya and Bran (now the Three-Eyed Raven) return
                    home to Winterfell; the Starks execute the treacherous Littlefinger. Tyrion persuades Daenerys not to destroy King's
                    Landing, reminding her that she does not want to be simply a queen of ashes. Instead, Jon goes North above the wall to
                    capture a wight to prove to Cersei that the fearsome army of the dead exist and are coming; in doing so, his group is
                    pinned down and nearly killed. Daenerys rescues them with her dragons, but the Night King kills one of her dragons and
                    makes it part of his army.

                    <p>The final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the
                    Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne. In the first half of the season, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and
                    many of the main characters converge at Winterfell to face the Dead. During the battle, Bran lures the Night King into
                    the open where Arya destroys him; the army of White Walkers and wights crumble. Meanwhile, Cersei Lannister remains in
                    King's Landing and strengthens her forces to set traps for a weakened Daenerys. The second half of the season resumes
                    the war for the throne as Daenerys suffers losses until she finally assaults King's Landing upon Drogon, her last
                    dragon. She defeats Cersei's forces, burns the city and kills Cersei and her brother Jaime. Daenerys vows to "liberate"
                    the whole world as she has liberated the capital of Westeros. Unable to sway her from her destructive path, an agonized
                    Jon kills her. Drogon flies away with her body. The leaders of Westeros choose Bran Stark as King, who grants the North
                    independence and appoints Tyrion his Hand. Sansa Stark is crowned Queen in the North. Arya sails west, and Jon leads the
                    Wildlings north of the Wall.
